# brute-force-sorting-alsgos

## three algorithms are implimented here.
1. selection sort
2. bubble sort
3. bubble sort with escape clause

we then compare the 3 in terms of time complexity over a variety of randomlly generated lists which need to be sorted. bubble sort
Timing should be measured in nanoseconds. The input size should start at N = 1000 and go up to (and including) N = 20000 in steps of 1000.
Note that all algorithms should be given the same data.
For example, for an vector of size 1000, all algorithms should be given as input that exact same vector (not different vectors of size 1000.Average these results over 5 runs (the vectors between runs should differ, so the vector of size 1000 on run 1 should be different
from the same sized vector on run 2).

we plot time vs list size as a visual representation of the comparison using python
